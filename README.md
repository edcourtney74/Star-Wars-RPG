# Star-Wars-RPG
In this Star Wars role playing game, the user chooses from one of four characters to attack the other three.

## Features
  * Each character has a different amount of hit points that he can take before being defeated. 
  * The attacking player has a random attacking power assigned that continues to increase power during gameplay.
  * Each defending character has a random counterattack power, which stays the same during gameplay.
  * Hit points, attack power and counterattack power are determined randomly each game, so the user can continue to play and have a different experience each time.
  * The user also chooses the order of opponents he or she will face.
  * After the first opponent has been defeated, the user will choose the second opponent.
  * If all three opponents are defeated, the user wins.
  * A battle log keeps the player updated on each round of the fight.
  * A reset button lets the player start a new game at any time.
  * The attack button and reset buttons are hidden or disabled during appropriate parts of gameplay to lessen the likelihood of clicking the wrong button on accident.
  * Game alerts the user if he or she won the game, lost the game or if both ran out of hit points in the same round.
